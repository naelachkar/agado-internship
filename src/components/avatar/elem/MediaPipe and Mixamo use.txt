MediaPipe and Mixamo use different coordinate systems for their poses, so you will need to perform a conversion to transform the coordinates from one system to the other.

MediaPipe's pose estimation output is based on a coordinate system where the origin is at the center of the image and the x and y coordinates range from -1 to 1, with positive x to the right and positive y downwards. The z coordinate represents the depth of each joint relative to the camera.

Mixamo's pose representation uses a different coordinate system where the origin is at the center of the hips and the x, y, and z coordinates are in meters relative to this origin. The positive x axis points to the right, the positive y axis points forward, and the positive z axis points upward.

To convert MediaPipe pose coordinates to Mixamo, you will need to perform the following steps:

Scale the MediaPipe coordinates to match the scale of the Mixamo coordinate system. You can do this by multiplying the x, y, and z coordinates by a scaling factor. For example, if your Mixamo character has a height of 1.8 meters and your MediaPipe output ranges from -1 to 1, you can scale the coordinates by multiplying by 0.9 (since 1.8/2 = 0.9).

Translate the MediaPipe coordinates to match the origin of the Mixamo coordinate system. You can do this by subtracting the coordinates of the center of the hips in the Mixamo character from the MediaPipe coordinates. You can find the center of the hips by taking the average of the left and right hip joint positions in the Mixamo skeleton.

Swap the y and z coordinates. Mixamo uses the y coordinate for forward/backward movement and the z coordinate for upward/downward movement, whereas MediaPipe uses the opposite convention. So you will need to swap the y and z coordinates to convert between the two systems.

After performing these steps, you should have converted the MediaPipe pose coordinates to the Mixamo coordinate system.
